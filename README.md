# Communication-Request-Web-App

At my previous internship as a Data Engineer at GEOTAB, I built a web application interface to streamline departmental communication requests by integrating input validation and data parsing. I utilized technologies such as AppScripts, Bootstrap, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript.

I was tasked with solving the problem of the lack of a streamlined pipeline for communication requests from department managers. The solution required minimal maintenance, minimal human interaction, and included validation testing. The data was then stored in a table for analysis and further action.

## Web Application

## Data Table

You can visit the Data Table [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12Mp-Y-2mc2yOQAn34oyHnaxKh5V6O1gU3CETaLfCdNM/edit?usp=sharing).

**Note:** The application and data table should be open to use without logging into your Google account as I have changed the access settings. However, you might still need to log in.
