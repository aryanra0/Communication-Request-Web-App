# Communication-Request-Web-App

At my previous internship as a Data Engineer at GEOTAB, I built a web application interface to streamline departmental communication requests by integrating input validation and data parsing. I utilized technologies such as AppScripts, Bootstrap, HTML, and JavaScript.

I was tasked with solving the problem of the lack of a streamlined pipeline for communication requests from department managers. The solution required minimal maintenance, minimal human interaction, and included validation testing. The data was then stored in a table for analysis and further action.
